\usage{
corePCA(DATA, M = NULL, W = NULL, decomp.approach = 'svd', k = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{DATA}{original data to decompose and analyze via the singular value
decomposition.}

\item{M}{a vector or diagonal matrix with masses for the rows
(observations). If NULL, one is created or the plain SVD is used.}

\item{W}{a vector or diagonal matrix with weights for the columns
(measures). If NULL, one is created or the plain SVD is used.}

\item{decomp.approach}{string. A switch for different decompositions
(typically for speed). See \code{\link{pickSVD}}.}

\item{k}{number of components to return (this is not a rotation, just an
\emph{a priori} selection of how much data should be returned).}
}
\value{
Returns a large list of items which are also returned in
\code{\link{epPCA}} (the help files for those functions will refer to this
as well).\cr All items with a letter followed by an \emph{i} are for the
\emph{I} rows of a DATA matrix. All items with a letter followed by an
\emph{j} are for the \emph{J} rows of a DATA matrix.\cr\cr \item{fi}{factor
scores for the row items.} \item{di}{square distances of the row items.}
\item{ci}{contributions (to the variance) of the row items.}
\item{ri}{cosines of the row items.} \item{fj}{factor scores for the column
items.} \item{dj}{square distances of the column items.}
\item{cj}{contributions (to the variance) of the column items.}
\item{rj}{cosines of the column items.} \item{t}{the percent of explained
variance per component (tau).} \item{eigs}{the eigenvalues from the
decomposition.} \item{pdq}{the set of left singular vectors (pdq$p) for the
rows, singular values (pdq$Dv and pdq$Dd), and the set of right singular
vectors (pdq$q) for the columns.} \item{X}{the final matrix that was
decomposed (includes scaling, centering, masses, etc...).}

\description{
corePCA performs the core of principal components analysis (PCA), and
related techniques.

This function should not be used directly. Please use \code{\link{epPCA}}
unless you plan on writing extensions to ExPosition.
