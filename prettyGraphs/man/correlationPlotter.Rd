\arguments{
\item{data_matrix}{A set of data (i.e., original measures and observations)}

\item{factor_scores}{One set of factor scores that were computed from the
original data matrix.}

\item{x_axis}{Which axis is the x-axis? Default is 1.}

\item{y_axis}{Which axis is the y-axis? Default is 2.}

\item{col}{A single-column matrix of colors for each data point.}

\item{pch}{A single-column matrix of pch for each data point. Indicates
which point style to use for each item. See \code{\link{par}}.}

\item{xlab}{A label to be placed along the x-axis.}

\item{ylab}{A label to be placed along the y-axis.}

\item{main}{A title to be placed at the top of the graph.}

\item{axis.lwd}{numeric. Line width for the axes.}

\item{circle.lwd}{numeric. Line width for the circle.}

\item{circle.col}{color for the circle}

\item{asp}{numeric. Aspect ratio (see \code{asp} in \code{\link{par}}).}

\item{dev.new}{boolean. If TRUE, \code{\link{dev.new}} is called internally
to create new device. If FALSE, a device must already be open.}

\description{
Computes and plots a correlation circle (used in multivariate analyses).
Correlation is computed between measured items and components (factors,
dimensions, principal axes, etc...).
