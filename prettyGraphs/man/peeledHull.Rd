}
\arguments{
\item{data_matrix}{A set of data you would like to plot on 2 dimensions
(e.g., a scatter plot). Can be original data or factor scores or anything
with at least 2 columns.}

\item{x_axis}{Which axis is the x-axis? Default is 1.}

\item{y_axis}{Which axis is the y-axis? Default is 2.}

\item{percentage}{The percentage of points that should be enveloped by the
hull.}

\item{col}{The color of the hull (see col in plot()).}

\item{lwd}{The thickness of the hull line (see lwd in plot())}

\item{lty}{The line type (see lty in plot()).}
}
\description{
Computes and plots a peeled hull around a set of points onto a current
graphics device.

The code for this function was (barely) adapted from Michael
Greenacre's book on correspondence analysis. All credit for this code should
go to Michael Greenacre; I only turned it into a function. The original code
